# Rebel The Taurusian
This is who I am.

2019 gave me too many things and took from me much more than it gaves. After shitty things happen, I started to run away from the pain inside my mind and I used to have much more time in my room, using discord, wondering bots.

# Same Year Different Numbers
Meanwhile running from the ultimate pain of reality by learning coding and try to be a "coder", I've gone as far away as I could go. Furthermore, I went futher. 
2020 gave me this. 2020 gave me the path to run on. With 2020 I started to learn about software and coding.

My actual learning style was something like this:
1. Searching about codes
2. Finding some useful things
3. Copy them
4. (The most important one) Changing them to get errors
5. Having errors
6. Searching for the solution
7. Understanding the error by solving them
8. Creating a new code with the earnings from the first code

In this new path, I've learned nodejs. Until 2020 has started I wouldn't imagine that I could do something with javascript...
So, 2020 gave me lots of new friends, knowledge about lots of modules and last one and the best one is, 2020 gave me the way out from my feelings.
2020 took my dog.

Now I'm trying to making my dog's name immortal by making bot of him.
Rest in peace [Nacho](https://top.gg/bot/722731833967771648), you'll never gonna be forgotten.
